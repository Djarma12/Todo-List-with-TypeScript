## Description

- I recently completed a TODO list project to expand my knowledge of TypeScript. The project is a functional application for managing tasks.

- As a newcomer to TypeScript, I found the project to be challenging yet rewarding. One of the main challenges was organizing the code structure for maintainability and scalability. I leveraged TypeScript's strong typing system to streamline debugging.

- Another interesting aspect was implementing local storage to save changes.

- The result is a polished application showcasing my TypeScript skills. I believe this project demonstrates my ability to create high-quality, organized code for real-world scenarios.
